[staticjscms.netlify.app](https://staticjscms.netlify.app/) 

A CMS for static site generators. Give users a simple way to edit
and add content to any site built with a static site generator.

> **DISCLAIMER**: This package/repository is under heavy development and as such is very unstable at current. A stable release is targeted for around the end of the year and will be labeled `1.0.0`. Documentation may not be completely accurate prior to the `1.0.0` release.
>
> An beta build for the stable release is available under the `@next` tack on npm.

## How It Works

Static CMS is a single-page app that you pull into the `/admin` part of your site.

It presents a clean UI for editing content stored in a Git repository.

You setup a YAML config to describe the content model of your site, and typically
tweak the main layout of the CMS a bit to fit your own site.

When a user navigates to `/admin/` they'll be prompted to log in, and once authenticated
they'll be able to create new content or edit existing content.

# Installation and Configuration

The Static CMS can be used in two different ways.

* A Quick and easy install, that requires you to create a single HTML file and a configuration file. All the CMS JavaScript and CSS are loaded from a CDN.
  To learn more about this installation method, refer to the [CDN Hosting Guide](https://staticjscms.netlify.app/docs/add-to-your-site-cdn/)
* A complete, more complex install, that gives you more flexibility but requires that you use a static site builder with a build system that supports npm packages.
  To learn more about this installation method, refer to the [Bundling Guide](https://staticjscms.netlify.app/docs/add-to-your-site-bundling/)
